## 🔄 **REMAINING TASKS FOR PUBLISHING**

### 1. **CRITICAL: Fix Dependencies**
**Current Status**: Using path dependencies for development
**Action Required**: Before publishing, replace all path dependencies with version constraints

```yaml
# In flutter_geofence_manager/pubspec.yaml, change:
dependencies:
  geo_fencing_platform_interface: ^1.0.0  # instead of path: ../geo_fencing_platform_interface
  geo_fencing_android: ^1.0.0             # instead of path: ../geo_fencing_android
  geo_fencing_ios: ^1.0.0                 # instead of path: ../geo_fencing_ios

# In geo_fencing_android/pubspec.yaml, change:
dependencies:
  geo_fencing_platform_interface: ^1.0.0  # instead of path: ../geo_fencing_platform_interface

# In geo_fencing_ios/pubspec.yaml, change:
dependencies:
  geo_fencing_platform_interface: ^1.0.0  # instead of path: ../geo_fencing_platform_interface
```

### 2. **Publishing Order**
**IMPORTANT**: Packages must be published in this order:
1. `geo_fencing_platform_interface` (dependency of others)
2. `geo_fencing_android` (depends on platform interface)
3. `geo_fencing_ios` (depends on platform interface)
4. `flutter_geofence_manager` (depends on all others)

### 3. **Package Names**
- [ ] Update `homepage` URLs in all pubspec.yaml files
- [ ] Update `author` information in iOS podspec
- [ ] Consider using a proper organization namespace instead of `yourusername`

### 4. **Final Testing**
- [ ] Test with version dependencies (not path dependencies)
- [ ] Verify all platforms work correctly
- [ ] Run `flutter analyze` on all packages
- [ ] Test example app functionality

## 📋 **PUBLISHING COMMANDS**

```bash
# 1. Publish platform interface first
cd geo_fencing_platform_interface
flutter pub publish --dry-run
flutter pub publish

# 2. Publish Android implementation
cd ../geo_fencing_android
flutter pub publish --dry-run
flutter pub publish

# 3. Publish iOS implementation
cd ../geo_fencing_ios
flutter pub publish --dry-run
flutter pub publish

# 4. Publish main package
cd ../flutter_geofence_manager
flutter pub publish --dry-run
flutter pub publish
```

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **Path Dependencies**: The current setup uses path dependencies for development. These MUST be changed to version constraints before publishing.

2. **Package Order**: The platform interface must be published first since other packages depend on it.

3. **Version Consistency**: All packages are now at version 1.0.0. After first publish, you can increment versions as needed.

4. **Testing**: Always run `--dry-run` first to catch any issues before actual publishing.

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Development Ready**: ✅ YES  
**Publishing Ready**: ❌ NO (due to path dependencies)

**Next Action**: Replace path dependencies with version constraints, then publish packages in order.
